1.12.2 Forge Based

Designed around Casual Enjoyment rather than Strict Gameplay, examples are:

- 1 Ore to 3 Ingots in Tinkers Construct Smeltry and EnderIO Sag Mill [Not Guarunteed for all Ores]. As for TiCon Smeltery, 1:3 Returns helps newer and weaker Players with Alloying... A lot!
- Mod that enables Keeping Inventory & Disables Mob Griefing
- No Mobs in Overworld thanks to Hunting DImensions Config Edit [Spawners will still work fine].
- However, Mob Fighting is now OPT IN via the Hunting Dimension Portal, for when you are ready...

FEATURES:

- TECH, Lots of TECH. No Magic, just TECH... and Super Powers of course. Maybe a little genome editing...
- LOTS of custom world generation - Exploration is a must! Dungeons and Loot galore! Even maybe the Central Spire of Atlantis or even a Seedship to find for the Stargate Fans.
- Once you're done exploring, take to the stars either by Rocket or Starship - then return by Stargate! Explore the Galaxy...
- LOTS of weird and wonderful Mods: Lucraft, Heroes Expansion, Woot, Waystones & Stargate Network to list some
- Birds Foods instead of Pam's Harvestcraft - same idea, except no world gen [such as Berry Gardens, Apple Trees, etc] and the lag that comes with such world gen on weaker pc/laptops...

TIP: Speaking of Stargate Network. If your Gate has SKY ACCESS during a THUNDERSTORM, dial it! There's a 5% chance the Gate will be dramatically redirected, Maybe into a Hidden "Ancient Repostiry Cavern"! [the loot!...].

KAKUSEI QUESTBOOK (AKA: The Wiki; Being Actively Updated)

QUESTBOOK NOTES:

- Google Doc Format.
- Goal is for a chronological, step by step explaination of each mod and when you should attempt it [the chronological nature is being checked at the moment].
- Questbook was written from a Vanilla Player's Perspective, sorry if it's a little too detailed, but my Test Players needed this [eg: Starts with the differences between Vanilla and Modded (JEI & JourneyMap Explaintions and such) ].
- It is written as a guide on each Mod in the Pack as well as the timing/order I felt the Player should attempt achieving each Questbook Entry.
